    <h1 class="eggTitle">Oba Gyoza</h1>
    <p class="descEgg" style="text-align: justify;"><Strong>"Oba Gyoza"</Strong>, which is a direct recipe from Nikkaidou in his popular work <b>"Dorohedero"</b>. 
        Handmade from the dough to the doughy crust, this is an exquisite daita dumpling that takes a lot of time and effort. </p>
    <h2 class="directions">Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul class="procedure">
        <li>Flour 200g (7.05oz)</li>
        <li>Water to taste</li>
        <li>As many shiso leaves as you like! Minced pork 200g (7.05oz)</li>
        <li>1/2 cabbage</li>
        <li>1/4 white onion</li>
        <li>3 dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
        <li>Garlic (grated)</li>
        <li>Ginger (grated)</li>
        <li>"Hungry Bug's special "combination seasoning"</li>
        <li>Sake</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="directions">Directions:</h2>
    <ol class="procedure">
        <li>Soak dried shiitake mushrooms in enough water to soak, and let them soak for about half a day.</li>
        <li>Make a pile with flour, make a hole in the center, add water and mix. Knead the dough well, adding water little by little until all the flour is gone.</li>
        <li>
            When the dough comes together, cover with a wet cloth and let rise for about 30 minutes. If you let the dough rise, you can make a delicious 
            ough that is sticky and does not tear easily.</li>    
        <li> 
            Add the minced pork, finely chopped shiso leaves, cabbage, white onion, dried shiitake mushrooms, garlic, ginger and other ingredients, 
            Hungry Bug's special "combination seasoning" (to taste), sake, salt and a little soy sauce, and mix vigorously until sticky.
        </li>
        <li>Shape the dough into a stick and cut it into a single skin.</li>
        <li>
            Dust a cutting board with potato starch or flour and roll out the dough with a cotton swab. 
            This is quite difficult! I recommend turning the dough 90 degrees at a time and pressing it 
            with a rolling pin, gradually bringing it closer to a circular shape. The author's lack of training resulted in a very distorted circle...
        </li>
        <li>Spread shiso leaves on the skin, fill with more bean jam and wrap it up. The skin is thicker than commercial ones, so you can fill it with a little more.</li>
        <li>Place the dumplings on a well-heated and oiled frying pan or hot plate, add water when browned, cover with a lid and steam bake.</li>
        <li>Serve dumplings on a plate in the style of a Nikkaidou, and you're done! </li>
    </ol>
